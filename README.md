Simple examples of genetic algorithms.
University project, originally with MATLAB, to be transcoded in Python.

# Python environment

The project is managed with [Rye](https://rye-up.com/) ([`astral-sh/rye`](https://github.com/astral-sh/rye)).

1. Install Rye
1. `rye sync` creates the venv from `pyproject.toml`
1. If you use VSCode to edit/run Jupyter notebooks, select the Python kernel in `.venv`.
